# RandoSmut

NSFW
Randomly generate truly terrible erotic fiction

---

RandoSmut is a project to play with Angular and parsing whilst amusing myself deeeply. It goes without saying that this will absolutely produce content that is not safe for work.

The content produced by RandoSmut is intended to shock, dismay, entertain, appal and hopefully arouse, but it not intended to offend. However, as the senetences it produces are randomly generated this is a possibility. If this does happen, please let me know by raising an issue.

## Using RandoSmut

The latest build is available on [GitHub pages](https://p-wm.github.io/rando-smut/), but if you wish to run it locally all you need is a classic:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Roadmap

1. [x] Set up skeleton files and tests for generator;
2. [x] Implement working generator;
